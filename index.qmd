I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of [A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing](https://usman-afzali.github.io/nzavs-flourishing/), at [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz) in New Zealand. I completed my PhD in psychology from University of Canterbury in 2022.

My training has been in cognitive psychology and in neuroscience - primarily focusing on memory suppression, and on using EEG brainwave data to detect criminal knowledge. In addition, I also conduct research in contemplative neuroscience attempting to examine neural signals (EEG) during contemplative practices. Furthermore, I conduct research in human flourishing - trying to discover predictors of flourishing and wellbeing in religious groups.

I use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.

Psychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science. Therefore, I am also actively involved in producing and sharing code via [GitHub](https://github.com/usman-afzali) using `RStudio` and `Quarto` (mainly `R`, but also `MATLAB` and `Python`).

I am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in psychology.
