    "text": "The Flourishing Lab has been established in Jan, 2023 at University of Canterbury. It consists a team of multidisciplinary researchers from across New Zealand. The aim is to discover and study factors that affect human flourishing, meaning-making, resilience, and wellbeing.\nThe current project of the The Flourishing Lab is A National Longitudinal Study of Muslim Diversity and Flourishing. It is aimed to discover predictors of flourishing and resilience, and exploring diversity in New Zealand Mulsim community by conducting a longitudinal panel study in the context of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).\nIn the panel study, data are collected from the sampe participants overtime.\n\nProject Summary\nNZAVS is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders that started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, less than 0.5% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by 2,000 participants, thus enabling to explore Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level.\n\n\nWhy we need this project?\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing, and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this project will address an urgent scientific need and clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths.\nMuch of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. However, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships and foster Muslims’ interest by involving them in longitudinal science.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. With this project, we have established The Flourishing Lab at University of Canterbury | Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha, that would attract further research and scholarship.\nThe target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six scientific publications.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the the Muslim Flourishing Study. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n\nPrivacy\nWe take privacy extremely seriously. Since the beginning of NZAVS (14 years ago), we have put practices in place that ensure our participants’ identities and personal information are kept strictly confidential. Please read further about our privacy here.\n\n\nGot questions?\nPlease contact Usman Afzali usman.afzali@canterbury.ac.nz"

    "text": "I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing, at University of Canterbury in New Zealand. I completed my PhD in psychology from University of Canterbury in 2022.\nMy training has been in cognitive psychology and in neuroscience - primarily focusing on memory suppression, and on using EEG brainwave data to detect criminal knowledge. In addition, I also conduct research in contemplative neuroscience attempting to examine neural signals (EEG) during contemplative practices. Furthermore, I conduct research in human flourishing - trying to discover predictors of flourishing and wellbeing in religious groups.\nI use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.\nPsychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science. Therefore, I am also actively involved in producing and sharing code via GitHub using RStudio and Quarto (mainly R, but also MATLAB and Python).\nI am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in psychology.\nFields of Research\n\nHuman Flourishing\nContemplative Neuroscience\nCognitive Psychology: memory suppression\nForensic Neuroscience\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nAs PI and postdoctoral research fellow in A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing\nAs PI in Controlling unwanted memories: A multisite registered replication of the Think/No-Think effect\nAs PI in Resting EEG microstates during contemplative practices\n\nCurrent Courses\n\nPostgraduate Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience\nUndergraduate Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics.\n\nAwards\n\nGeorgina Carvell Memorial Prize\nUniversity of Canterbury Doctoral Scholarship\n\nGrants\n\nA national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing"
