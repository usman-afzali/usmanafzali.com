    "text": "The Flourishing Lab has been established in Jan, 2023 at University of Canterbury. It consists a team of multidisciplinary researchers from across New Zealand. The aim is to discover and study factors that affect human flourishing, meaning-making, resilience, and wellbeing.\nThe current project of the The Flourishing Lab is A National Longitudinal Study of Muslim Diversity and Flourishing. It is aimed to discover predictors of flourishing and resilience, and exploring diversity in New Zealand Mulsim community by conducting a longitudinal panel study in the context of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).\nIn the panel study, data are collected from the sampe participants overtime.\n\nProject Summary\nNZAVS is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders that started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, less than 0.5% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by 2,000 participants, thus enabling to explore Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level.\n\n\nWhy we need this project?\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing, and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this project will address an urgent scientific need and clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths.\nMuch of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. However, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships and foster Muslims’ interest by involving them in longitudinal science.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. With this project, we have established The Flourishing Lab at University of Canterbury | Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha, that would attract further research and scholarship.\nThe target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six scientific publications.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the the Muslim Flourishing Study. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n\nPrivacy\nWe take privacy extremely seriously. Since the beginning of NZAVS (14 years ago), we have put practices in place that ensure our participants’ identities and personal information are kept strictly confidential. Please read further about our privacy here.\n\n\nGot questions?\nPlease contact Usman Afzali usman.afzali@canterbury.ac.nz"

    "text": "Many prospective PhD students ask about my experience, but I don’t usually have an answer from the top of my head: I’ve learned that I can be bad in dealing with surprise questions and scenarios :)\nBut when I put my thoughts together and reflect on the previous 12 months, this article is what my mind tells me. Last year this time I was juggling many things:\n\nFinishing up my PhD\nTeaching assistance in two courses\nTeaching assistant coordination in another course\nLecturing in a course\nRevising and resubmitting a paper\n\nLooking for a post PhD job - this takes time and a lot of stress if you are looking for an academic career. A year later, I’m still juggling: Teaching, publishing, looking for jobs, and applying for research grants. There are costs to this type of academic life: I sacrificed my social life, I go home late, I work during the weekends.\nDon’t get me wrong. I never for a second think that my life is balanced. But trying to get into academia is demanding. It is competitive - although you don’t have a clear competitor. You always need to be growing and getting better. This is what I call your drive - that you really are after it. Put differently, if you don’t like research, it will be extremely hard to push yourself during graduate school. Nothing wrong with having “no research” interests. Each of us have different personalities and aspirations.\nYou also need to be passionate about what you want to pursue. Without passion about a topic, it will be difficult to keep moving, e.g., working when others are on holidays and keeping writing when others have a social life.\nWith these comes commitment. You need to be committed to what you want to achieve. It basically overlaps with passion. Planning and having a vision is good, but ask yourself if you really want to add those hours (obviously more than 40) in a week.\nAnd above all, a great academic network is what you need. With a multi-layered local, national, and international network, you’d be surprised how fast you grow and how easy it gets. I know some of us want to keep it to ourselves and in rare times, we want our idea not to be stolen :)\nBut as one of my great mentors puts it, “your ideas only grow when you have others’ perspectives”. My experience has been the same. And frankly speaking, most of these academics that you would want to network with, have their own established careers and won’t be stealing your ideas. Ironically, I was cautioned about “my idea being stolen” by someone early in the graduate school. But when sharing ideas and networking only helped me do better, I was surprised as to how misleading some grad school advice can be. And finally, please note that this has been my subjective experience. It may or may not work for everyone else. I know many would want to have set working hours, take breaks, have holidays, have a social life, etc. That too works and I have seen it working for my colleagues.\nEnd.\nP.S. I sometime feel like I could write a book about my study in New Zealand coming from a refugee camp with English as my third language. There is A LOT to say - mostly positive, sometimes negative, and at times, devastating. But let’s leave that for another time."

    "text": "There is a need to bring all resources that relate to Git and GitHub together because some of the available videos and links are outdated. In addition, online resources are either too long or they only address a small part of the bigger picture.\n\nInstalling Git on to Mac\nOpen Mac Terminal and install Homebrew by:\n\nCopy the “Install Homebrew” link from the website:\n\n\n\n\nFigure showing a screenshot of homebrew website\n\n\n\nPaste the link into the Mac terminal and press enter.\nTo ensure that homebrew is installed, type “brew –version”.\nInstall git by typing “brew install git”.\nCheck installation by typing “git –version”. It will show you the latest (current) version.\nIf you ever wanted to upgrade git, simply follow steps 4 and 5, and it will update and overwrite the previous version.\n\nNow you can close the Mac terminal and conduct the rest of processing from the RStudio terminal.\nNote. If you need help with creating an SSH key, visit here: Connecting to GitHub with SSH.\n\n\nFirst, create an RStudio project on your computer\nOnce created, then access it from the RStudio terminal using the following command - considering the folder is named Git-GitHub-2022, for example, on your Mac’s Desktop:\ncd ~/Desktop/Git-GitHub-2022\nIn RStudio, create a markdown document and name it “README.md”.\n\n\nCreate a repo on GitHub\nIt can be either public or private depending on your preference. Once created, it will show the following screen:\n\n\n\nFigure showing GitHub screen after repository creation\n\n\nRun the first line of the code - and the current README.md document will be replaced/overwritten in the directory (it only happens because I am adding these instructions and setting up the repo at the same time). Make sure you save the current markdown document (README.md) before running the first line of the code.\necho \"# Git-GitHub-Mac-2022\" >> README.md\ngit init\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"first commit\"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:usman-afzali/Git-GitHub-Mac-2022.git\ngit push -u origin main\nThen run the rest of the lines.\nYou will see the new README.md file has been added your GitHub environment/repository (repo). Now click the Git dialogue box on RStudio (see below) and tick all check boxes.\n\n\n\nFigure showing Git dialogue box on RStudio\n\n\nClick commit, type a commit message, click commit, close, and push. Refresh the GitHub screen and note that the new files have been added to the remote (GitHub) repository.\n\n\nGit clone\nUsed in case you lose access to the repo on the local machine. First, cd where you want the cloned repository to appear. Then follow the command below (e.g., if you are cloning the current repo).\ngit clone git@github.com:usman-afzali/Git-GitHub-Mac-2022.git\n\n\nSet up gitignore\nType names of all files inside the current directory that you don’t want to be pushed to the GitHub repo. They can be history files (that are already in gitignore), sensitive files, or maybe large files. In addition, add .DS_Store to gitingore too. The soon you change a file (any file), it will show up in the Git terminal on RStudio. And as the previous section, we add a commit message and push it to the remote GitHub repo.\n\n\nGit branching on local repo\nWhen git is created as above, it will only have a “main” branch. You can see this with the command:\ngit branch\nAll git processing, until now, happens in the “main” branch.\nA new branch (e.g., called “Rcode”) can be added onto the local git repo:\ngit branch Rcode\nNow, the “git branch” command will show you both branches, with the active branch showing a * before its name. To use the new branch, use:\ngit checkout Rcode\nNow, you can see that the active branch is “Rcode”. Any additions at this stage will be within the Rcode branch. Create a new file inside the new branch “sample-code-cars.R”. Once you commit, the newly created sample-code-cars.R file will not be pushed into GitHub remote repo. The file disappears when you switch branch.\nTo bring the new file into the main branch on remote repo, merge the “Rcode” branch into the main branch (you should be in the main branch to do so):\ngit merge Rcode\nThis is known as fast-forward merge. If you bring any new changes to the “Rcode” branch or sample-code-cars.R file on this branch, you need to merge again. These changes will not automatically merge into the main branch.\n\n\nDeleting and renaming a branch\nNeed to be outside a branch first. Then use:\ngit branch -d <branch name>\nTo rename, be inside that very branch. Then use:\ngit branch -m <branch name>\n\n\nUsing Git outside RStudio\nIf needed, you can use git outside RStudio too, using Mac terminal. For example, you want to use git on your Desktop for version control of a file. Opening terminal, you can access Desktop with\ncd ~/Desktop\nCreate a git repository:\nmkdir git-repo\nTo enter new repo:\ncd ~/Desktop/git-repo\nIf you check git status (below) in this directory, you will see the following message: “fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git”\ngit status\nIf you type “ls” in the terminal and hit return, you will see no content because it is an empty folder.\nUse the following command to initialize git:\ngit init\nNow that git has been initialized, you can see the hidden files within this folder by using:\nls -a\nGet inside .git folder\ncd ~/Desktop/git-repo/.git\nThen command ls and you will see all items inside.\nTo get out of each directory, use:\ncd ..\nFrom .git, it will take you two such steps (commands) to get back to the Desktop.\nIf at any stage, you want to know where you currently are located, use the following command and it will give you the directory address.\npwd\nFor instance, if you were in git-repo that you previously created, it will show you the following:\n\n\n\nterminal screenshot\n\n\nIf needed to show hidden files, the following commands, one after another, are to be used. Change yes to no to hide them again.\ndefaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles yes\nkillall Finder\n\n\nExtra\n\nUse “clear” to clean the terminal.\nIf you added a new file on GitHub, you can use the “pull” command from git dialogue box to bring that file to your local machine repository.\nA more sophisticated way - before the pull command - will be to use git fetch - that helps you see what the new additions are before pulling them to your local repo. Use:\n\ngit fetch origin\n…followed by git status. And you will see that the main branch is behind by 1 commit (related to the newly added file). The you can use the following to access the remote directory and see the newly added file(s):\ngit checkout origin/main\nIt will show you the file name. You can then access/see the new file in the local repo. The following command shows what is inside the new file:\ncat <filename.extension>\nOnce you are happy with the new file, you can checkout/switch to the local repo (main) and use pull to permanently bring the new file(s) in to the local repo. Besides the git dialogue box, you can also use the following command to pull the newly added file.\ngit pull origin main\n\nUse “git log” at any stage to see all of the commits.\n\n\n\nAdding a branch on GitHub (remote repo)\nA branch can be created on GitHub by typing a name in the window shown below after clicking on “main”:\n\n\n\nFig new branch on GitHub\n\n\nFor example, the new branch is called “pycode” within which a python file can be created, named “experimental.py”. When you fetch git, it tells you that we have a new branch: \nSwitch to the new remote repo:\ngit checkout origin/pycode\n… And access contents of the new file:\ncat experimental.py\nFinally, merge the new file as explained before. But you need to switch to the main branch first.\ngit checkout main\ngit merge origin/pycode\nOnce merged, there is no need to pull the file because now the new file has been merged into the local repo.\n\n\nReferences and further info:\n\nInstall Git on MacOS (Macbook M1, M1 Max, M1 Pro, M2) and push project into Github | Homebrew - YouTube video\nSee Fibonacci numbers with Git and GitHub - a GitHub repo.
