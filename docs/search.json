    "section": "",
    "text": "Authoritarian restrictions on domestic and international civil society have increased over the past decade, but authoritarian states continue to allow—and even invite—NGOs to work in their countries. Though the services and advocacy provided by NGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of authoritarian regimes, the majority of autocratic states allow NGO activities, and NGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions and attempts to limit their activities. This chapter examines the theories about and the experiences of domestic and international NGOs working in authoritarian countries. The review is premised on the theory of authoritarian institutions: dictators delegate political authority to democratic-appearing institutions in order to remain in power and maintain stability. After providing a brief overview of authoritarian institutionalism and balancing, I discuss how domestic and international NGOs fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. I then look at three forms of state–NGO relationships in the context of authoritarianism and explore how autocrats have addressed and regulated international NGOs in particular. Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most repeated phrases in any introductory statistics class is the warning that “correlation is not causation.” This chapter presents new non-statistical language for creating, measuring, and evaluating causal stories and relationships using observational (i.e. non-experimental) data. It introduces the concept of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allow us to formally encode our understanding of causal stories. With well-crafted DAGs, one can use a set of rules called do-calculus to make specific adjustments to statistical models and isolate or identify causal relationships between variables of interest. Edges (or arrows) transmit associations between nodes. Following the fundamental problem of causal inference, answering causal questions without an experiment appears impossible. The chapter explores different methods of making adjustments using synthetic data. Instead of throwing away potentially useful data, one can use other methods to create matches that are less discrete and more informative."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Collaboration and its promotion by funders continue to accelerate. Although research has identified significant transaction costs associated with collaboration, little empirical work has examined the broader, societal-level economic outcomes of a resource-sharing environment. Does an environment that encourages collaboration shift our focus toward certain types of social objectives and away from others? This paper uses agent-based Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that collaboration is particularly useful when resources are rare but a social objective is commonly held. However, collaboration can lead to bad outcomes when the objective is not commonly shared; in such cases, markets outperform collaborative arrangements. These findings suggest that encouraging a resource-sharing environment can lead to inefficiencies even worse than market failure. We also demonstrate that failure to account for transaction costs when prescribing collaboration can result in quantifiably lower outcome levels than expected."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "Abstract\nA wave of legislative and regulatory crackdown on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) has constricted the legal environment for foreign advocacy groups interested in influencing domestic and global policy. Although the legal space for advocacy is shrinking, many INGOs have continued their work and found creative ways to adapt to these restrictions, sometimes even reshaping the regulatory environments of their target countries in their favor. In this article, I explore what enables INGOs to cope with and reshape their regulatory environments. I bridge international relations and interest group literatures to examine the interaction between INGO resource configurations and institutional arrangements. I argue that specific resource and managerial characteristics provide organizations with ‘programmatic flexibility’ that enables groups to adjust their strategies without changing their core mission. I illustrate and test this argument with case studies of Article 19 and AMERA International and demonstrate how organizations with high programmatic flexibility can navigate regulations and shape policy in their target country, while those without this flexibility are shut out of policy discussions and often the target country itself. I conclude by exploring how the interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments shape and constrain the effects of interest groups in global governance."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcological theorists have generated several yet unresolved disputes that try to untangle the difficulty in understanding the nature of complex ecological communities. In this paper, we combine two recent theoretical approaches that used together suggest a promising way to consider how evolutionary and ecological processes may be used to frame a general theory of community ecology and its functional stability. First, we consider the theoretical proposal by Mark Vellend (2016) to focus on a small set of higher-level evolutionary and ecological processes that act on species within an ecological community. These processes provide a basis for ecological theory similar to the way in which theoretical population genetics has focused on a small set of mathematical descriptions to undergird its theory. Second, we explore ideas that might be applied to ecosystem functioning developed by Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio’s (2015) work on how biologically autonomous systems emerge from closure of relevant constraints. To explore the possibility that combining these two ideas may provide a more general theoretical understanding of ecological communities, we have developed a stochastic, agent-based model, with agents representing species, that explores the potential of using evolutionary and ecological processes as a constraint on the flow of species through an ecosystem. We explore how these ideas help illuminate aspects of stability found in many ecological communities. These agent-based modeling results provide in-principle arguments that suggest that constraint closure, using evolutionary and ecological processes, explains general features of ecological communities. In particular, we find that our model suggests a perspective useful in explaining repeated patterns of stability in ecological evenness, species turnover, species richness, and in measures of fitness."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the weeks since the January 25 revolution there have been dozens of explanations for Mubarak’s downfall. Political scientists, diplomats, economists, sociologists, and even international aid workers have proposed theories to explain the economic, political, historical, and social causes of the Egyptian revolution. Despite the plethora of interdisciplinary theories in the press and in academia, few—if any—have analyzed Mubarak’s resignation in the light of managerial dynamics and behavior.\nIn addition to a ripe political environment, horrible economic conditions, and a mobilized and angry population, Mubarak’s fall from power can be attributed to his failure as a public manager. This paper analyzes Mubarak’s managerial strategy throughout the course of his presidency by (1) reviewing the structure of the National Democratic Party (NDP) and Mubarak’s relationship with it; (2) analyzing the foundational principles and assumptions of his strategy‚ both as the leader of Egypt and as the chairman of the NDP; and (3) tracing the application of that strategy and determining its effectiveness in confronting “the management challenge” over a period of 30 years."

    "text": "Amid the academic and policy critiques of the United States 15-year push to eliminate human trafficking, the perspective of the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working with anti-trafficking advocacy and services has been largely ignored. This article presents the results of a global survey of nearly 500 anti-trafficking NGOs in working in 133 countries, and is the first NGO-focused survey of its kind. Based on the results of the survey, we provide an overview of the anti-trafficking NGO sector as a whole, detail the relationship between anti-trafficking NGOs and the US, and account for some of the variation in NGO opinions of US efforts. Notably, we find that NGOs are remarkably satisfied with US-led efforts—despite their acknowledged flaws—and that NGOs believe that American anti-TIP policies are important and, on balance, helpful. These results also provide a warning for the future of the United States’ anti-trafficking advocacy, suggesting that the US avoid politicizing its annual Trafficking in Persons Report."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws provide little information in predicting future repression, their patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties."

While this crackdown has been shown to have a negative impact on public funding flows, we know little about how it impacts private philanthropy. How does information about crackdown abroad, as well as organizational attributes of nonprofits affect individual donors’ willingness to donate internationally? Using a survey experiment, we find that learning about repressive NGO environments increases generosity in that already-likely donors are willing to donate substantially more to legally besieged nonprofits. This generosity persists when mediated by two organizational-level heuristics: NGO issue areas and main funding sources. We discuss the implications of our results on how nonprofits can use different framing appeals to increase fundraising at a time when traditional public donor funding to such organizations is decreasing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Flourishing Lab has been established in Jan, 2023 at University of Canterbury. It consists a team of multidisciplinary researchers from across New Zealand. The aim is to discover and study factors that affect human flourishing, meaning-making, resilience, and wellbeing.\nThe current project of the The Flourishing Lab is A National Longitudinal Study of Muslim Diversity and Flourishing. It is aimed to discover predictors of flourishing and resilience, and exploring diversity in New Zealand Mulsim community by conducting a longitudinal panel study in the context of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).\n\nProject Summary\nNZAVS is a nationally representative panel study of New Zealanders that started in 2009. It is currently following 38,551 participants, almost 1% of the New Zealand’s adult population. Over 20% of NZAVS survey items were developed with global virtue experts to specifically investigate the interplay of religion, virtue, and flourishing as people age. Despite strong NZAVS coverage of New Zealand’s population, less than 0.5% of New Zealand’s Muslims are currently participating in the study (n = 70). The proposed project will build on existing Muslim community partnerships to boost the NZAVS Muslim sample by 2,000 participants, thus enabling to explore Muslim flourishing longitudinally on a national level.\n\n\nWhy we need this project?\nA panel study follows the same individuals over time and is ideal for addressing questions about how life experiences combine with beliefs and circumstances that affect human flourishing. However, because the necessary longitudinal datasets are lacking, little is known about the dynamics of Muslim faith and flourishing. It is important to address this gap in understanding because: (a) religion has long been theorized to play an enabling role in human flourishing, and (b) Islam is a growing religion. As such, the systemic study of Muslim flourishing is among science’s greatest uncharted frontiers. In addition, Muslims have been the targets of stereotyping and prejudice in New Zealand. By capitalizing on NZAVS infrastructure, this project will address an urgent scientific need and clarify the extent of Muslim diversity, mechanisms of resilience, and lines of similarity with other faiths.\nMuch of our work to date with the Muslim community has focused on conveying information about how Muslims are perceived. However, we have identified strong signals of Muslim interest in flourishing science: recently, we have talked with 29 Muslims from diverse backgrounds across New Zealand. They had a 100% agreement on conducting research on Muslims self-perception, as well as the scientific study of Muslim flourishing. Therefore, we believe that the proposed project will amplify our community partnerships and foster Muslims’ interest by involving them in longitudinal science.\nThis project will have the most importance to Muslims as explained above. Additionally, it will also be important to the public, and to understanding about Muslims living in the Western countries that share a similar way of life with New Zealand.\nThis project will give us a scientific understanding of Muslim flourishing, thereby, a timely and under-researched connection of religion and flourishing will be explored. The data from this project could also be used by NZAVS researchers who publish on other aspects of life such as health, politics, life satisfaction, etc. This is substantial because due to minute participation of Muslims in the ongoing NZAVS research, we do not have meaningful understanding about these aspects of Muslims in New Zealand. With this project, we have established The Flourishing Lab at University of Canterbury | Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha, that would attract further research and scholarship.\nThe target audience of this project are the Muslim community, academics, science readers, rights advocates, and policy makers. The outputs are a rich longitudinal dataset of 3660 observations, 6 public talks, a seminar for government officials, and six scientific publications.\n\n\nPurpose\nThis website is intended to provide introduction to the the Muslim Flourishing Study. Furthermore, findings, progress reports, publications, and data analysis code will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n\nPrivacy\nWe take privacy extremely seriously. Since the beginning of NZAVS (14 years ago), we have put practices in place that ensure our participants’ identities and personal information are kept strictly confidential. Please read further about our privacy here.\n\n\nGot questions?\nPlease contact Usman Afzali usman.afzali@canterbury.ac.nz"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political science have developed largely within the frequentist framework (i.e., Blackwell and Glynn 2018; Imai and Kim 2019; Torres 2020). In this article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the estimation of causal effects (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020; Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). Extending the approach to causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under selection on observables introduced by Blackwell and Glynn (2018), we develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the context of parametric survival analysis and linear mixed effects models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed method."

However, states are increasingly relying on repressive legislation to crack down on NGOs within their borders. How have foreign aid donors responded to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues, and channeling more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs. While our findings challenge existing notions of foreign aid running on “autopilot,” they also have worrying implications for Western donors and domestic NGOs working on contentious issues."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments have imposed restrictions on movement, association, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. In many cases, such as New Zealand, these emergency measures have been temporary and respect for human rights has returned to normal. In many other instances, however, governments have used these restrictions to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. Systematically measuring the consequences of COVID restrictions, however, is a difficult task. We will examine two possible quantitative measures of the relationship between of COVID restrictions and civil society space. First, we will use the Variety of Democracy project’s newly released Pandemic Violations of Democratic Standards Index to explore if and how civil society restrictions predict pandemic backsliding. Second, while many countries sign international human rights treaties that ostensibly bind states to respect rights, several treaties allow for emergency derogations from these obligations. We will tabulate formal human rights treaty derogations due to the pandemic and explore whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights. We hope that our exploration of these two measures will provide rich data-based descriptions of the relationship between COVID restrictions and civic space that will allow for more causal work in the future."

However, these advancements have been less used among nonprofit scholars and practitioners. In this article, we provide a methodological guide for applying causal inference tools within nonprofit studies. We walk through practical examples of model-based and design-based approaches from epidemiology and econometrics to observational causal inference, including causal models, inverse probability weighting, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. We include empirical illustrations of these approaches by replicating existing nonprofit research and program evaluations. We conclude with a call for more careful and explicit attempts at making causal claims in nonprofit studies."

    "text": "I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing, at University of Canterbury in New Zealand. I completed my PhD in psychology from University of Canterbury in 2022.\nMy training has been in cognitive psychology and in neuroscience - primarily focusing on memory suppression, and on using EEG brainwave data to detect criminal knowledge. In addition, I also conduct research in contemplative neuroscience attempting to examine neural signals (EEG) during contemplative practices. Furthermore, I conduct research in human flourishing - trying to discover predictors of flourishing and wellbeing in religious groups.\nI use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.\nPsychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science. Therefore, I am also actively involved in producing and sharing code via GitHub using RStudio and Quarto (mainly R, but also MATLAB and Python).\nI am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in psychology.\nFields of Research\n\nHuman Flourishing\nContemplative Neuroscience\nCognitive Psychology: memory suppression\nForensic Neuroscience\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nAs PI and postdoctoral research fellow in A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing\nAs PI in Controlling unwanted memories: A multisite registered replication of the Think/No-Think effect\nAs PI in Resting EEG microstates during contemplative practices\n\nCurrent Courses\n\nPostgraduate Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience\nUndergraduate Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics.\n\nAwards\n\nGeorgina Carvell Memorial Prize\nUniversity of Canterbury Doctoral Scholarship\n\nGrants\n\nA national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing"
