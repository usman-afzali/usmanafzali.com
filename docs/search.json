    "text": "I am a postdoctoral research fellow and PI of A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing, at University of Canterbury in New Zealand. I completed my PhD in psychology from University of Canterbury in 2022.\nMy training has been in cognitive psychology and in neuroscience - primarily focusing on memory suppression, and on using EEG brainwave data to detect criminal knowledge. In addition, I also conduct research in contemplative neuroscience attempting to examine neural signals (EEG) during contemplative practices. Furthermore, I conduct research in human flourishing - trying to discover predictors of flourishing and wellbeing in religious groups.\nI use experimental (behavioural as well as neuroscientific) and observational methods.\nPsychology fascinates me a great deal and my lifelong goal is to conduct good science and contribute to open science. Therefore, I am also actively involved in producing and sharing code via GitHub using RStudio and Quarto (mainly R, but also MATLAB and Python).\nI am experienced in teaching statistics and research methods and my immediate goal is to become a permanent (tenure-track) lecturer in psychology.\nFields of Research\n\nHuman Flourishing\nContemplative Neuroscience\nCognitive Psychology: memory suppression\nForensic Neuroscience\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nAs PI and postdoctoral research fellow in A national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing\nAs PI in Controlling unwanted memories: A multisite registered replication of the Think/No-Think effect\nAs PI in Resting EEG microstates during contemplative practices\n\nCurrent Courses\n\nPostgraduate Computational Contemplative-Neuroscience\nUndergraduate Intermediate Research Methods and Statistics.\n\nAwards\n\nGeorgina Carvell Memorial Prize\nUniversity of Canterbury Doctoral Scholarship\n\nGrants\n\nA national longitudinal study of Muslim diversity and flourishing"
